    "If there are multiple variables that are related through some kind of linear function, we can express the system of equations in matrix-vector notation. Simulating the system then works exactly the same way as previously, with the only difference that we are iterating an equation that consists of matrices and vectors, rather than scalars. In this tutorial, we will also touch upon transforming a higher-order system into a first-order system of higher dimensionality, as it makes the computation somewhat simpler.\n",
