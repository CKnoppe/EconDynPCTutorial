    "# 3 Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between difference equations and differential equations is that the former model a system in discrete time, i.e. the evolution between one point in time and the next, while the latter model a system in continuous time. This raises an important issue for simulations of such models: computers only work in discrete states (1 & 0, ultimately), so \"true\" continuity cannot be implemented. Hence, we have to wok with approximations. Usually that creates a trade-off between accuracy (how close is the solutions to the true, e.g. analytically derived solution?) and computational efficiency (how much work does the computer  have to do, and how long is it going to take?).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, three different timestepping methods will be introduced:  explicit & implicit Euler methods, as we  as the Crank-Nicolson method. You will write functions to simulate the behaviour of a first-order differential equation. Instead of plotting the results, we will analyse efficiency and accuracy of the methods this time."

Applying the Crank-Nicolson method, the new error is around four times smaller as $\\delta$ is halved, i.e. we achieve much faster convergence (second order).
