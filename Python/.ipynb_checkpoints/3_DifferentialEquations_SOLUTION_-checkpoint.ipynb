    "The key difference between difference equations and differential equations is that the former model a system in discrete time, i.e. the evolution between one point in time and the next, while the latter model a system in continuous time. This raises an im portant issue for simulations of such models: computers only work in discrete states (1 & 0, ultimately), so \"true\" continuity cannot be implemented. Hence, we have to wok with approximations. Usually that creates a trade-off between accuracy (how close is the solutions to the true, e.g. analytically derived solution?) and computational efficiency (how much work does the computer  have to do, and how long is it going to take?).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, three different timestepping methods will be introduced:  explicit & implicit Euler methods, as well as the Crank-Nicolson method. You will write functions to simulate the behaviour of a first-order differential equation. The results will be plotted, and we will analyse efficiency and accuracy of the methods."

Write the function such that its output is the price after one full time unit, while the parameter $T$ is the number of steps this unit should be divided into. Hence, in the first step, you have to calculate $\\delta$ as the inverse of $T$. Do not store the intermediate values of $p$, but overwrite it in every step and only return the final value. Later, we can use this function to simulate several timesteps, storing only the values after a full period has passed."

Using Euler methods, the errors are halved if the step sized is halved, so errors will be proportional to $\\delta$ (first-order convergence). Applying the Crank-Nicolson method, the new error is around four times smaller as $\\delta$ is halved, i.e. we achieve much faster convergence (second order). That means we can use larger values of $\\delta$ and still obtain the same accuracy, leading to much higher computational efficiency (fewer calculations for the same outcome)."
